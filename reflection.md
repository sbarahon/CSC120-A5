- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affectes your programming?

My initial impressions of how `Association` affects my programming is that certain classes can have a relationship with many other classes and this really comes down to the decisions we make as programmers. For example, if I was going to make a scarecrow, I probably would have just constructed each separate piece as different methods under one class and then call one method that prints them altogether. But, I wonder if having them as separate classes gives us any benefits such as methods we can assign to different objects which might not be so applicable to this particular assignment since none of our objects neceesarily did anything but print themselves to the console. But, maybe in a different assignment it would be useful to have all objects be their own separate class. 


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I thought setting up the separate classes and the banner output was pretty straightforward for me. I struggled a little to construct the banner to be resizable but this was moreso me not being familiar with Java methods rather than conceptual stuff. I was very confused on step 4 which was implementing the input through the command line. I had to look to external resources that explained step by step how to do that because I have no experience running a program through the command line. So, I guess advice for someone taking this course in the future would be, potentially consulting the professor if something isn't making sense or you don't know where to start something or taking advantage of the many online resources that are available for Java and trying to implement that in your code.
